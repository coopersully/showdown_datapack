# Vanilla Expansion for Minecraft 1.16+
Showdown is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that completely immerses the player in a superpowered, battle-royale gamemode. This gamemode requires a fresh minecraft world, but creates an extensive story-driven gamemode in which players are pinned against eachother in a super-soldier training simulation nicknamed "Showdown." There are brand new weapons, tools, abilities, and overhauled game mechanics to suit the player's combat needs.
